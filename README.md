# Generative models for 3D MRI scans
This repo contains architectures of generative models for 3D brain MRI scans. 

## Presented models: 
- Autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- GAN
- ProgressiveGAN
- StyleGAN v1

## Data
The models were trained using [Humanconnectome Young Adults](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/1200-subjects-data-release) brain sMRI scans.
